My visual argument concerns the high maternal mortality rate we have in the United States despite it being a first world country. The target audience is the employers of pregnant women and aims to effectively lead them to a resource that shows how they can help in this situation. The layout of the argument is  suppose to resemble flyer that could initially grab the readers attention. Then the reader(employer) would hopefully go and check out the link I've left below to see what they can do to help.
